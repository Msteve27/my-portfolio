<!-- about me -->
  <section class="about-me">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p> I was born and raised in Chicago, IL, however, the long winters drove me south to the great state of Tennessee. 
    Here, I went to school at the University of Tennessee (go vols!) and graduated with a B.S. in chemistry. Since then I have moved to Nashville where I currently reside.
    In my free time I workout, fish, and hike the Appalachian Mountains. I'm Extremely passionate about health and fitness, as well as friends, family, and work. 
    Fun fact about me: I can't WAIT until we have self-driving cars and I would want nothing more than to work on a programming team to make this a reality.
